        <h2>About me</h2>
      
        <p>Edmar Souza's research focuses on answering open questions about the fundamental structure of matter. By studying the electrons and photons produced in the energetic collisions of protons at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, Edmar conducts measurements using the ATLAS Detector, that is seeking out the existence of never-before-seen particles, and characterize the particles and forces that we know of with greater precision. </p>
        <p> Edmar's work into the properties and measurements of the experimental signatures of these eletromagnetic particle showers. In addition to studying these phenomena, Edmar works extensively on the electron/photon trigger algorithms and operation of the ATLAS detector, including the calorimeter and reconstruction systems that allow for these detailed measurements. Edmar is also working with state-of-the art high-speed electronics for quickly indentify the events collected by the ATLAS detector. </p> 
        <p> In physics analysis his contributions include new machine learning based methodologies for exotic dark matter candidates identification, with photons in final states (Long Lived Axion-Like Particles), working together colleagues at Sorbonne Universite (France). </p>
        <p> Edmar received his PhD from Federal University of Bahia in 2021 and his bachelor degree in Electronic Engineering from the Area 1 - Science and Technology University in 2011. He was a Posdoctoral Fellow in the Laboratoire de Physique Nucléaire et des Hautes Energies (LPNHE) - CNRS / Sorbonne Universite - Paris/France, from 2022-2024. e is currently a Permanent Professor at the Polytechnic School of the Federal University of Bahia, in Brazil, working mainly in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Program.</p>
