        <h2>Research</h2>
      
        <p>Machine Learning for Electron and Photon Identification: In trigger systems for particle physics experiments, the selection need to be fast and efficient to identify rare signatures in high rate proton-proton collisions. In this topic I am interested in how we can improve both feature extraction methods based on calorimetry signals and how we can build efficient machine learning models feed by physics knowledge, to guide the learning procedure in the neural networks. </p>
        
        <p>Particle Shower Simulation: Lorenzetti Shower is a computational framework developed by scientists from Brazilian universities UFRJ, UFBA, IFBA, UERJ in collaboration with the Sorbonne Universite for the particle shower simulation that interact in a finely segmented calorimeter. In this work, computational intelligence, feature extraction and signal reconstruction techniques have been developed for the research and development of new triggering and pattern recognition techniques in particle physics.</p>
        
        <p>Data Quality: Electrons and photons are involved in rare physics process related to the standard model and beyond. To assess the performance of the online reconstruction, expert systems for monitoring and data quality (DQ) assesment of the particles that are detected by the different triggers are necessary. In this work I have been developing integrated DQ and monitoring tools to evaluate online electron and photon triggers in ATLAS. I have also researched machine learning applications for this purpose.</p>
      
        <p>Calibration: In this investigation, machine learning models are designed to reduce the difference between the energy deposited by electrons in simulation, in relation to the energy measured in experimental data. The main purpose is to possibly correct the simulation models so that they can get as close as possible to the signals measured in proton-proton collisions.</p>
